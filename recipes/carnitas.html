    <h2 class="des">Description</h2>
    <p>This carnitas recipe makes juicy Mexican pulled pork. I get requests from friends and family to make this repeatedly. The pork is braised with lime and spices for a delicious, distinctive flavor, then baked until fall-apart tender. Serve with warm, fresh tortillas and salsa.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 pounds pork shoulder, cut into several large pieces</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>4 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season pork shoulder pieces with salt, then arrange in the Dutch oven. Cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in onion, garlic, lime juice, chili powder, oregano, and cumin. Pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until pork is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer pork shoulder to a large baking sheet; reserve cooking liquid. Drizzle a small amount of cooking liquid over pork pieces and lightly season with salt.</li>
        <li>Bake pork in the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Drizzle more cooking liquid every 10 minutes; use two forks to shred pork as it browns.</li>
    </ol>
